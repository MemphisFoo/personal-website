            Welcome to my website! In <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kelliher">the year of our lord 2022</a>, I decided to finally pivot career paths and move over to software engineering.

             This is my first ever website (if you don't count a very bad Wordpress blog I created back in 2011), so click around to learn a bit more about me.
